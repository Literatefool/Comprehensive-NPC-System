	WARNING: UseAnimationController is an ADVANCED optimization
	- Offloads ALL physics to client
	- Client has full position authority (no anti-exploit validation)
	- Requires extensive testing
	- NOT recommended for beginners

	For implementation details, see:

		UseAnimationController - Enable client-side physics simulation

		CRITICAL WARNINGS:
		1. NO physics on server at all
		2. Client handles ALL pathfinding and movement
		3. Client has full position authority (no validation - prevents ping false positives)
		   >> We accept that clients can manipulate NPC positions
		   >> This is intentional trade-off for smooth gameplay at all ping levels
		4. Only suitable for non-critical NPCs (ambient, visual-only)
		5. Requires more testing for specific use cases
		6. Everything is rendered on client-side for optimization

		When enabled:
		- Server stores positions and health (no HumanoidRootPart, no physics)
		- Health managed by server for gameplay integrity
		- Client calculates pathfinding (using NoobPath)
		- Client simulates jumps (physics simulation)
		- Client handles all physics and movement
		- NPCs only rendered when player is nearby
		- Instead of HumanoidRootPart, only positions are saved

		Performance: Can handle 1000+ NPCs with barely any lag
		Security: Client has position authority (no validation - prevents ping-related false positives)
		          Health remains server-authoritative to protect gameplay integrity
		Use Case: Ambient NPCs, crowds, background characters (non-gameplay-critical)

		DO NOT USE FOR:
		- Combat NPCs (enemies, bosses)
		- NPCs that drop loot or rewards
		- NPCs tied to game progression
		- Any NPC that affects gameplay outcomes
